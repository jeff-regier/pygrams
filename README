Defining a Vocabulary

To define a vocabulary, first run "form_candidates.py" to create a 
file containing all possible n-grams. Then, run "filter_candidates.py" 
to find just the n-grams which appear sufficiently frequently in 
relation to the frequency of their components.

---------------------------------------------------

Converting Documents

Upon creating a vocabulary file, you can convert documents to n-grams 
by running "convert_docs.py".
